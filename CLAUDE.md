## Project Overview

This is "blue-elephant-fast-engine" (蓝象开源的引擎集成最佳实践相关代码) - a project for Blue Elephant's open source engine integration best practices. The repository currently contains minimal content with only a README file.

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with:
- Only a README.md file present
- No source code, configuration files, or build scripts yet
- Clean git repository with initial commit

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository without established tooling:
- No package.json or dependency management configured
- No build system or testing framework in place
- No linting or formatting tools configured

## Future Development Considerations

When adding code to this repository, typical setup might include:
- Adding package.json for Node.js projects or equivalent for other languages
- Setting up build tools and development scripts
- Configuring linting and formatting tools
- Adding testing framework and CI/CD pipelines
- Creating source code structure under src/ or similar directory

## Repository Language

The project uses Chinese in its documentation (README is in Chinese), indicating this may be primarily for Chinese-speaking developers or Chinese market integration practices.
